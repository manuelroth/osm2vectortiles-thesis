# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Creating a custom styled OSM map is one of the most common use cases among cartographers yet
it is very difficult to do so. With the new emerging technology of vector tiles it is possible
to allow anyone to create their custom OSM maps without downloading the entire database
and managing complex infrastructure. The task of this project is to make this as easy
as possible.
